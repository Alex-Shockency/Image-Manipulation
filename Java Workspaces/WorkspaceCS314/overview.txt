This java package provides both a class for creating a world and a class for creating a coordinate. The problems I ran into while creating this code were mostly figuring out how to properly wrap negative values in coordinate. I also ran into problems when creating a comprehensive test suite accounting for each boundary case. In addition to the previous problems I also ran into problems implmenting Junit as I was unfamiliar with the structure of a Junit class. Other than these issues the program went by smoothly enough.
